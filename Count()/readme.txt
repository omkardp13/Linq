he Count() method in LINQ is used to count the number of elements in a collection. You can either count all the elements in the collection or specify a condition to count only the elements that meet a certain criteria.


int count = collection.Count();                     // Counts all elements.
int count = collection.Count(x => x.SomeCondition); // Counts elements that satisfy a conditio
