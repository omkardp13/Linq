The Select() method in LINQ is used to project or transform each element of a collection into a new form. 
It allows you to apply a transformation to each element in a sequence, and return the transformed sequence as the result.

Key Points:

Transforms each element in a sequence using a lambda expression.
Can return a collection of the same type or a different type.
Often used for selecting specific fields, performing calculations, or converting one type of object to another.

Syntax:

var result = collection.Select(x => transformation);
x represents each element in the collection.
transformation is the logic applied to each element x.
1. Example: Basic Projection:
Transforming a list of integers by squaring each number.


List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

// Square each number
var squaredNumbers = numbers.Select(x => x * x);

foreach (var number in squaredNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);  // Output: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25
}
Here, each number in the numbers list is squared, and the result is a new sequence of the squared values.
